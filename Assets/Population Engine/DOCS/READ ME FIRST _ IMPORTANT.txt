In order to prevent any potential compatibility issues with different
versions of Unity:  The Unity Asset Store has required us to
remove the "Standard Assets" folder from the download.

So, as soon as you import our asset, please import the following:

1) Characters
2) Environment

These are only required to run some of the demo scenes,
such as the First Person Controller that allows you to
walk around the city demo.

These Standard Assets are *not* required for the actual functionality of our product.

If you require any assistance, please send an email to:

aibotsystem@gmail.com

include your Unity version and Operating System.

Good luck with your projects!
